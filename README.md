# LKS32MC07x_CMake_Template
A template project for LKS32MC07x with CMake  

This project contains the Standard library for LKS32MC07x from Linko Semiconductor (or LKSMCU), and a simple blinky/UART printing example.

I know nothing about Assembly, so I transplanted the startup file and the link script file with the reference of those for STM32, so there might be some bug which I haven't found yet.
